How I create my web portfolio:
HTML and CSS were used to create this portfolio. Throughout the HTML code I have used headers, sections, footers, and other semantic features, while in CSS I used flexbox for a grid layout. 

Challenges I faced:
It was challenging to overcome those issues during development because I enjoyed writing code. This was my first real-life project, creating something for myself that I will use in the job market when I graduate to get clients. I was not clear enough about many things before this project, including box layouts, CSS resets, font-face, alignment issues, etc. After completing this project, everything is clear now. 
It took me longer to complete this portfolio assignment as I have been sick with covid, but I had to keep on pushing myself.

Things I learned:
Flexbox is a time saver. It is a powerful CSS property and I mostly used it in this project to create easy box layouts.
Time management and starting my assignments before time and updating gradually saves a lot of stress and I do a better job this way.

Fontface - This technique allows me to use web fonts in my portfolio. 

CSS Reset - Rendered all browser elements more consistently and in line with mordern stardards. It reduces browser inconsistencies related to things like default line heights, margins, and font sizes. Everyone should use it.

Semantice Markup -In order to follow web standards, semantic markup is necessary. In order for me to use semantic markup, I had to understand the hierarchy of my content and how both humans and machines will read it.

List of assets I used that are not mine:
1. Fonts
2. Unsplash images as required by the course guidelines to avoid plagiarism. The images I used on the Contact page, and the services page were all from unsplash.
